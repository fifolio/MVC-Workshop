# Introduction and concept of MVC
MVC considered one of the most important architectural patterns in computer science for many years, MVC is a way to separate the user interface (UI) from other parts of an application. Where the project consists of three main aspects:

1. Model: It is a group of Classes that describe the form and structure of data such as the data that must be entered and others, in addition to the rules for dealing with it such as what data cannot remain empty and other restrictions and conditions, so all data files are placed inside the Models folder (handle data).

2. View: It is everything related to the user interfaces of the application, so that all interface files are placed inside the Views user interfaces folder (dealing with the interfaces).

3. Controller: A collection of Classes that handle user requests, basic operations of the application, and a point of contact with the user, Models files, and Views files.
